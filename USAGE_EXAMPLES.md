## Basic Interaction Examples

### Example 1: Simple Conversation

```
You: Hello JENOVA, how are you today?

JENOVA: Hello! I'm functioning well, thank you for asking. As an AI built on
The JENOVA Cognitive Architecture, I don't experience emotions in the way
humans do, but I'm ready and capable of assisting you. How can I help you today?

You: Can you explain what makes you different from other AI assistants?

JENOVA: Certainly! Unlike traditional stateless AI systems, I have several
distinctive features thanks to The JENOVA Cognitive Architecture designed by
orpheus497:

1. **Persistent Memory**: I remember our previous conversations and can build
   upon them over time. I won't forget who you are or what we've discussed.

2. **Learning Capability**: Through my reflection processes, I develop insights
   from our interactions and integrate them into my cognitive architecture.

3. **Graph-Based Cognition**: My Cortex system creates interconnected
   knowledge structures, allowing me to see relationships between concepts.

4. **Self-Reflection**: I can reflect on my own knowledge, identify gaps,
   and develop deeper understanding through meta-insights.

5. **User Modeling**: I build assumptions about your preferences and needs,
   which I verify with you to improve our collaboration.

Would you like to explore any of these features in practice?
```

### Example 2: Asking for Information

```
You: What is the capital of France?

JENOVA: The capital of France is Paris. It's one of the most populous and
culturally significant cities in Europe, known for landmarks like the Eiffel
Tower, the Louvre Museum, and Notre-Dame Cathedral.

Is there anything specific about Paris or France you'd like to know more about?

You: What's the population?

JENOVA: Paris has a population of approximately 2.2 million people within the
city limits. However, the greater Paris metropolitan area (Île-de-France region)
has a population of over 12 million, making it one of the largest urban areas
in Europe.

[After a few turns, JENOVA's scheduler triggers insight generation]

JENOVA: *I've developed a new insight about our conversation.*

[Insight saved: "User shows interest in European geography and demographics"]
```

### Example 3: Multi-Turn Context

```
You: I'm working on a Python project.

JENOVA: That's great! Python is a versatile language. What kind of project
are you working on? I can help with code, architecture, debugging, or
general guidance.

You: It's a web scraper for news articles.

JENOVA: Web scraping for news articles is a useful project. A few important
considerations:

1. **Libraries**: I'd recommend using `requests` and `BeautifulSoup` or
   `Scrapy` for more complex needs.
2. **Ethics**: Make sure to check the website's robots.txt and terms of service.
3. **Rate Limiting**: Implement delays to avoid overloading the server.

Would you like help with a specific aspect, like parsing HTML, handling
pagination, or storing the data?

You: How do I parse the HTML to extract just the article text?

JENOVA: For extracting article text from HTML, here's a common approach using
BeautifulSoup:

```python
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
import requests

def extract_article_text(url):
    response = requests.get(url)
    soup = BeautifulSoup(response.content, 'html.parser')

    # Most news sites use <article> or specific classes
    article = soup.find('article')

    if article:
        # Extract paragraphs within the article
        paragraphs = article.find_all('p')
        text = ' '.join([p.get_text() for p in paragraphs])
        return text
    else:
        # Fallback: get all paragraphs
        paragraphs = soup.find_all('p')
        text = ' '.join([p.get_text() for p in paragraphs])
        return text

# Usage
article_text = extract_article_text('https://example.com/news/article')
print(article_text)
```

This approach assumes articles are in `<article>` tags. You may need to adjust
based on the specific website's structure. Would you like help customizing this
for a specific news site?

## Learning and Memory Examples

### Example 13: Building Semantic Memory

```
Session 1:
──────────
You: I'm learning Rust programming.

JENOVA: That's great! Rust is a systems programming language known for memory
safety without garbage collection. What aspects are you focusing on?

You: Ownership and borrowing - it's a bit confusing.

JENOVA: Ownership is indeed Rust's most distinctive feature. The basic rules are:
1. Each value has a single owner
2. When the owner goes out of scope, the value is dropped
3. You can borrow references (immutable or mutable) to values

[Stored in Semantic Memory: "User is learning Rust, specifically ownership/borrowing"]

Session 2 (next day):
──────────────────────
You: Can you explain Rust ownership again?

JENOVA: Of course! I remember you were working on understanding Rust's ownership
model. Let me explain...

[Retrieved from Episodic Memory: Previous conversation about Rust]
[Retrieved from Semantic Memory: "User is learning Rust"]

[JENOVA provides explanation tailored to the remembered context]
```

### Example 14: Episodic Memory in Action

```
Session 1:
──────────
You: I'm thinking about building a portfolio website.

JENOVA: A portfolio website is a great idea! What's your background - are you
a developer, designer, photographer, or something else?

You: I'm a full-stack developer specializing in React and Node.js.

JENOVA: Perfect! For a developer portfolio, I'd recommend...

[Stored in Episodic Memory with metadata:
 - Entities: ["portfolio website", "React", "Node.js", "full-stack developer"]
 - Emotion: neutral
 - Timestamp: 2025-10-29T10:30:00]

Session 2 (a week later):
──────────────────────────
You: I've decided to start that portfolio site.

JENOVA: Great! I remember we discussed this last week - you're a full-stack
developer working with React and Node.js. Have you chosen a hosting platform yet?

[Retrieved from Episodic Memory: Previous conversation context]
[JENOVA continues with contextually relevant suggestions]
```

### Example 15: Assumption Formation and Verification

```
Turn 5 of conversation:
───────────────────────
[JENOVA's scheduler triggers assumption generation]

JENOVA (internal): Based on conversation patterns, the user appears to prefer
command-line tools over GUI applications.

[Assumption saved as: UNVERIFIED]

Turn 8 of conversation:
───────────────────────
[Scheduler triggers proactive verification]

JENOVA: Based on our conversations, I've noticed you often mention terminal
commands and CLI tools. I'm forming an assumption:

"You prefer command-line interfaces over graphical user interfaces for
development tasks."

Is this accurate?

You: Yes, I find CLIs faster and more scriptable.

JENOVA: Thank you for confirming. I've updated this assumption to VERIFIED → TRUE.

[Assumption status updated, will now influence JENOVA's recommendations]

Future conversation:
────────────────────
You: What's a good tool for monitoring system resources?

JENOVA: Since I know you prefer command-line tools, I'd recommend 'htop' or
'btop' for an interactive terminal resource monitor. Both offer real-time
system statistics with excellent keyboard navigation.

[Recommendation influenced by verified assumption]
```

## Cognitive Workflows

### Example 16: Research and Learning Workflow

```
Day 1: Initial Research
───────────────────────
You: I need to learn about microservices architecture.

JENOVA: Microservices is an architectural approach where applications are built
as a collection of small, independent services. Let me break this down...

[Conversation continues with detailed explanation]

You: /insight

JENOVA: Generated insight:
Topic: Software Architecture
Insight: "User is researching microservices architecture as a potential
architectural pattern for future projects."

You: Can you remember the key benefits of microservices?

JENOVA: Certainly! The main benefits are:
1. Independent deployment
2. Technology diversity
3. Fault isolation
4. Scalability...

[Stored in Semantic Memory as facts about microservices]

Day 3: Deeper Learning
──────────────────────
You: I want to learn more about service communication in microservices.

JENOVA: I remember we discussed microservices a couple of days ago. For service
communication, there are several patterns...

[Retrieved context from Episodic Memory]
[Retrieved facts from Semantic Memory]

You: How do I handle distributed transactions?

JENOVA: Great question! In microservices, traditional ACID transactions don't
work well. The common approaches are...

Day 7: Synthesis
────────────────
You: /reflect

JENOVA: Conducting deep reflection...

Meta-Insight Generated:
"User is systematically learning microservices architecture, progressing from
foundational concepts to advanced patterns like service communication and
distributed transactions. This suggests a planned migration or redesign of a
monolithic application to microservices."

JENOVA: Based on my reflection, I notice you've been building knowledge about
microservices systematically. Are you planning to migrate an existing application?

You: Yes! How did you know?

JENOVA: By analyzing the progression of our conversations and the interconnected
nature of your questions, I inferred this pattern. Would you like guidance on
migration strategies?
```

### Example 17: Project Planning Workflow

```
Week 1: Requirements Gathering
───────────────────────────────
You: I'm starting a new project - an inventory management system.

JENOVA: Interesting! Let's discuss the requirements...

[Extended conversation about features, users, scale]

You: /learn_procedure
Name: Inventory System Development
Steps: [User provides project workflow]

JENOVA: Procedure saved! I'll remember this workflow.

Week 2: Technical Decisions
────────────────────────────
You: What database should I use for the inventory system?

JENOVA: Based on our earlier conversation about your inventory management
project, and considering the requirements we discussed...

[Context retrieved from Episodic Memory]
[Provides tailored recommendation]

Week 3: Implementation
──────────────────────
You: I'm implementing the product catalog module.

JENOVA: That's the first core module we discussed in your project plan.
For the catalog, based on your requirement for...

[Pulls from stored procedural knowledge and previous conversations]

Week 4: Review
──────────────
You: /reflect

JENOVA: I've been tracking your inventory system project. Here's what I've
learned:

Meta-Insights:
1. Project follows a methodical approach: requirements → architecture →
   implementation
2. User prefers PostgreSQL for structured data and Redis for caching
3. Development velocity is steady, approximately one module per week

These insights will help me provide more relevant guidance as your project
continues.
```

### Example 18: Debugging Workflow

```
You: I'm getting a "connection timeout" error when calling my API.

JENOVA: Let's debug this systematically. First, a few questions:
1. Is this a new error or has the API worked before?
2. Are you calling it locally or remotely?
3. What's the timeout duration?

You: It worked before, calling remotely, timeout after 30 seconds.

JENOVA: Since it worked before, let's check recent changes...

[Conversation continues with diagnostic questions]

You: /learn_procedure
Name: Debugging API connection timeouts
Steps:
1. Check network connectivity
2. Verify API server is running
3. Check firewall rules
4. Review recent code changes
5. Check server logs
6. Test with curl command
7. Verify timeout configuration

JENOVA: Procedure saved! Next time you encounter connection issues, I can
guide you through this diagnostic process.

[Two weeks later]

You: Another connection timeout issue, different API.

JENOVA: I remember we debugged a similar issue before and created a diagnostic
procedure. Let me guide you through it:

Step 1: Check network connectivity
Can you ping the API server?

[JENOVA guides through the stored procedure]
```

## Document Processing Examples

### Example 19: Learning from Technical Documentation

```
# Assuming you've placed "kubernetes_guide.md" in src/jenova/docs/

You: /develop_insight

JENOVA: Scanning documents...

Found: kubernetes_guide.md (24 KB, new)

Processing kubernetes_guide.md...

[Chunk 1: Introduction to Kubernetes]
Summary: Kubernetes is a container orchestration platform that automates
deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.

Key Takeaways:
- Kubernetes manages clusters of containers
- Originated from Google's Borg system
- Open-source and CNCF-hosted
- Declarative configuration model

Questions answered:
- What is Kubernetes?
- Who created Kubernetes?
- What problems does Kubernetes solve?

[Chunk 2: Core Concepts - Pods and Services]
Summary: Pods are the smallest deployable units in Kubernetes, containing one
or more containers. Services provide stable endpoints for accessing Pods.

[... continues for all chunks ...]

JENOVA: Document processing complete!

Integrated knowledge:
- 12 document chunks processed
- 47 key takeaways extracted

[Retrieves from document knowledge in cognitive graph]
[Provides detailed explanation with source attribution]
```

### Example 20: Multi-Document Knowledge Synthesis

```
# Documents in src/jenova/docs/:
# - docker_basics.md
# - kubernetes_guide.md
# - microservices_patterns.md

You: /develop_insight

JENOVA: Processing 3 documents...

[After processing all documents]

You: /reflect

JENOVA: Conducting reflection across document knowledge...

Meta-Insight Generated:
"The three processed documents form a coherent learning path for cloud-native
development: Docker provides containerization fundamentals, Kubernetes builds
on those to provide orchestration, and microservices patterns show how to
architect applications for these platforms. There are strong relationships
between concepts across these documents."

Connections Established:
- "Docker containers" (docker_basics.md) ↔ "Kubernetes Pods" (kubernetes_guide.md)
- "Service discovery" (microservices_patterns.md) ↔ "Kubernetes Services" (kubernetes_guide.md)
- "Container images" (docker_basics.md) ↔ "Deployment artifacts" (kubernetes_guide.md)

Future conversation:
────────────────────
You: I want to deploy a microservice application.

JENOVA: Based on my integrated knowledge from the documents you provided,
here's a comprehensive approach:

1. Containerization (from Docker basics):
   - Package each microservice as a Docker container
   - Use multi-stage builds for optimization

2. Orchestration (from Kubernetes guide):
   - Deploy containers to a Kubernetes cluster
   - Use Services for service discovery
   - Configure horizontal pod autoscaling

3. Architecture (from Microservices patterns):
   - Implement the API Gateway pattern
   - Use circuit breakers for resilience
   - Consider event-driven communication

This synthesis comes from connecting concepts across all three documents
you provided.
```

High-Centrality Nodes (core concepts):
- Neural networks (centrality: 0.92)
- Gradient descent (centrality: 0.88)
- Loss functions (centrality: 0.85)

Strong Connections:
- Backpropagation ↔ Gradient descent ↔ Chain rule
- Supervised learning ↔ Loss functions ↔ Training data
- Neural networks ↔ Activation functions ↔ Non-linearity

You now have a searchable, interconnected ML knowledge base that I can query
and explain from multiple perspectives.
```

### Example 23: Collaborative Writing

```
You: I'm writing a blog post about REST API design.

JENOVA: Great! I can help with that. What aspect of REST API design are you
focusing on?

Steps:
1. Choose topic and target audience
2. Create outline
3. Write introduction
4. Develop main sections with examples
5. Add code snippets
6. Write conclusion
7. Review and edit

JENOVA: Procedure saved!

You: Can you help me write the introduction?

JENOVA: Based on your topic - REST API best practices - here's a draft
introduction...

[Collaborative editing session]

You: /insight

JENOVA: Insight generated:
"User follows a structured approach to technical writing, preferring outlines
before drafting, and values clear code examples."

[Two weeks later]

You: I'm writing another blog post about GraphQL.

JENOVA: I remember your technical writing workflow. Should we start with
an outline?

[JENOVA adapts to learned writing workflow]
```

Day 3: MongoDB Research
───────────────────────
You: Now I want to learn about MongoDB.

JENOVA: I remember you were researching PostgreSQL earlier. Switching to
MongoDB for comparison?

You: Exactly!

JENOVA: [Provides MongoDB information with implicit comparisons to PostgreSQL]

Day 7: Synthesis
────────────────
You: /reflect

JENOVA: I've analyzed your research on database technologies. Here's what
I've synthesized:

Meta-Insight: "User is conducting comparative analysis of relational (PostgreSQL)
vs. document (MongoDB) databases. Key comparison dimensions: ACID properties,
scalability, query capabilities, and use case suitability."

Comparative Summary:
PostgreSQL Strengths: ACID compliance, complex queries, relational integrity
MongoDB Strengths: Flexible schema, horizontal scalability, document model

Based on your research pattern, would you like me to suggest questions for
comparing other database types (e.g., Redis for caching, Cassandra for
distributed scenarios)?
```

### Example 26: Documentation Generation Assistant

```
You: I need to document this Python function:

def calculate_discount(price, customer_tier, promo_code=None):
    base_discount = TIER_DISCOUNTS.get(customer_tier, 0)
    if promo_code:
        promo_discount = PROMO_CODES.get(promo_code, 0)
        return price * (1 - base_discount - promo_discount)
    return price * (1 - base_discount)

JENOVA: Here's comprehensive documentation for your function:

```python
def calculate_discount(price: float, customer_tier: str, promo_code: str = None) -> float:
    """
    Calculate the final discounted price for a customer.

    This function applies tier-based discounts and optional promotional
    code discounts to a base price. Discounts are cumulative.

    Args:
        price (float): The original price before any discounts.
        customer_tier (str): The customer's tier level (e.g., 'bronze',
            'silver', 'gold'). Must be a key in TIER_DISCOUNTS.
        promo_code (str, optional): A promotional code for additional
            discount. Must be a key in PROMO_CODES. Defaults to None.

    Returns:
        float: The final price after applying all applicable discounts.

    Examples:
        >>> calculate_discount(100, 'gold')
        85.0  # Assuming 'gold' tier gives 15% discount

        >>> calculate_discount(100, 'silver', 'SUMMER2024')
        70.0  # Assuming 'silver' is 10% and 'SUMMER2024' is 20%

    Notes:
        - Discounts are applied multiplicatively: price * (1 - total_discount)
        - Invalid tier defaults to 0% discount
        - Invalid promo_code is ignored
    """
    base_discount = TIER_DISCOUNTS.get(customer_tier, 0)
    if promo_code:
        promo_discount = PROMO_CODES.get(promo_code, 0)
        return price * (1 - base_discount - promo_discount)
    return price * (1 - base_discount)
```

The documentation includes type hints, comprehensive docstring with parameters,
return value, examples, and important notes about behavior.

## Tips for Effective Use

### Maximizing Learning

1. **Use /insight regularly**: After significant conversations, generate insights
2. **Use /reflect periodically**: Weekly or bi-weekly to synthesize knowledge
3. **Verify assumptions**: Use /verify to ensure accurate user modeling
4. **Process documents**: Add relevant documents to src/jenova/docs/ and process them
5. **Teach procedures**: Use /learn_procedure for workflows you want JENOVA to remember

### Building Quality Training Data

1. **Depth over breadth**: Have detailed conversations rather than many shallow ones
2. **Correct mistakes**: When JENOVA is wrong, correct it (becomes training data)
3. **Explicit confirmations**: Confirm assumptions and insights for accurate labeling
4. **Diverse topics**: Cover various domains for a well-rounded personalized model
5. **Regular /train execution**: Generate training data incrementally to track progress

### Performance Optimization

1. **Context window management**: Longer conversations may hit context limits
2. **Memory pruning**: Cortex automatically prunes old nodes (configurable)
3. **Targeted insight generation**: Generate insights for specific topics
4. **Efficient document chunking**: Break large documents into smaller files
