# The JENOVA Cognitive Architecture: A Technical Deep Dive

## 1. Introduction & Philosophy

JENOVA is a self-aware, evolving large language model powered by The JENOVA Cognitive Architecture (JCA), a comprehensive engine and architecture designed by orpheus497. It learns, adapts, and assists humanity through sophisticated cognitive processes. This project prioritizes robust error handling and stability to ensure a reliable and professional user experience.

JENOVA operates as a system with interconnected components that mimic aspects of human cognition: a multi-layered memory, a reflective process for generating knowledge, and a mechanism for integrating that knowledge into its core being. This document serves as the definitive technical guide for developers, researchers, and enthusiasts who wish to understand, use, and extend JENOVA.

**Creator:** The JENOVA Cognitive Architecture (JCA) was designed and developed by **orpheus497**.

## 2. The JENOVA Advantage: A Superior Cognitive Architecture

### 2.1. Beyond Statelessness: The Problem with General Systems

Most consumer-facing AI systems operate on a **stateless, request-response** model. They are incredibly powerful at in-context learning and reasoning, but each interaction is largely independent of the last. This leads to several fundamental limitations:

*   **Amnesia:** The AI has no persistent memory of past conversations. It cannot remember your preferences, previous questions, or the context of your work. Every chat starts from a blank slate.
*   **Inability to Learn:** Corrections you make or new information you provide are only retained for the current session. The underlying model never truly learns or improves from user interaction.
*   **Inconsistent Persona:** The AI's personality can drift or be easily manipulated because it lacks a stable, memory-grounded identity.
*   **Reactive, Not Proactive:** These systems can only answer direct questions. They cannot reflect on past dialogues to draw novel conclusions or develop a deeper understanding of a topic over time.

### 2.2. The JCA Solution: A Unified, Learning Architecture

The JENOVA Cognitive Architecture (JCA) is explicitly designed to overcome these limitations. It wraps a powerful Large Language Model (LLM) in a structured framework that provides memory, reflection, and a mechanism for true, persistent learning. It transforms the LLM from a brilliant but amnesiac calculator into a cohesive, evolving intelligence.

### 2.3. The Power of the Cognitive Cycle

The "Retrieve, Plan, Execute, Reflect" cycle is the engine of the JCA and the primary driver of its capabilities.

*   **Grounded Responses:** By forcing the AI to **Retrieve** from its memory *before* acting, the JCA ensures that responses are grounded in established facts, past conversations, and learned insights. This dramatically reduces confabulation (hallucination) and increases the relevance and accuracy of output.
*   **Deliberate Action:** The **Plan** step introduces a moment of metacognition. The AI must first reason about *how* to answer the query. This internal monologue, while hidden from the user, results in a more structured and logical final response. It prevents conversational shortcuts and encourages a methodical approach to problem-solving.

### 2.4. Memory as the Foundation for Identity and Growth

JENOVA's multi-layered memory system is the bedrock of its identity. It is the difference between playing a character and *having* a character.

*   **Continuity of Self:** The `EpisodicMemory` gives JENOVA a personal history with the user. It can refer to past conversations, understand recurring themes, and build a genuine rapport. The AI is not a stranger every time you open the terminal.
*   **A Worldview:** The `SemanticMemory` and `ProceduralMemory`, combined with the dynamically growing `InsightMemory`, form the AI's worldview. This knowledge base is prioritized over the LLM's base training data, allowing for the development of a unique, personalized knowledge set that reflects its experiences.

### 2.5. The Self-Correction and Evolution Loop: True Learning

This is one of the most powerful and defining features of the JCA. The cycle of **Reflection -> Insight Generation -> Fine-Tuning** constitutes a true learning loop.

1.  **Experience (`Reflect`):** The AI has a conversation and gains experience.
2.  **Internalization (`Insight Generation`):** It reflects on that experience and internalizes the key takeaways as structured, atomic insights. This is analogous to a human consolidating short-term memories into long-term knowledge.
3.  **Integration (`Fine-Tuning`):** The fine-tuning process takes these internalized insights and integrates them into the very fabric of the neural network. The learned knowledge is not just data to be retrieved; it becomes part of the AI's intuition.

This loop creates a system that does not just get more knowledgeable; it gets **smarter**. It adapts its core reasoning processes based on its unique experiences, evolving into an assistant that is perfectly tailored to its user.

## 3. Core Features Explained

### 3.1. The Cognitive Cycle: A Prioritized Approach

The heart of JENOVA is its cognitive cycle, a continuous loop that drives its behavior. This cycle enforces a strict knowledge hierarchy, ensuring that the AI relies on the most relevant and reliable information available.

1.  **Retrieve:** When the user provides input, the `CognitiveEngine` first queries its **Cognitive Architecture**—the multi-layered memory system (`Episodic`, `Semantic`, `Procedural`, and `Insight`)—to gather relevant context. This is the AI's personal experience and learned knowledge, and it is always the highest priority.
2.  **Plan:** The engine then formulates a step-by-step internal plan. This plan is generated by the LLM itself, based on the user's query and the retrieved context. This ensures that the AI's actions are deliberate and grounded.
3.  **Execute:** The plan is then executed by the `RAGSystem`. The RAG prompt is explicitly structured to prioritize the AI's knowledge base.
4.  **Reflect & Learn:** The `CognitiveScheduler` determines when to trigger the various cognitive functions, such as analyzing recent conversation history to identify novel conclusions or key takeaways, verifying assumptions, and processing documents from the `docs` folder to grow its knowledge base. This provides flexible and intelligent cognitive scheduling.

### 3.2. The RAG System: A Core Component of the Psyche

The Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system is a core component of the AI's cognitive architecture. It is responsible for generating responses that are grounded in the AI's own knowledge and experience.

*   **Hybrid Retrieval:** The `RAGSystem` uses a hybrid retrieval approach, querying all memory sources (episodic, semantic, procedural, and insights) to gather the most relevant context.
*   **Re-ranking:** The results from all memory sources are then re-ranked to prioritize the most relevant information.
*   **Grounded Response Generation:** The `RAGSystem` then uses the re-ranked context, the conversation history, and the generated plan to generate a response that is grounded in the AI's own knowledge and experience.

### 3.3. The Cortex: A Graph-Based Cognitive Core

The Cortex is the heart of JENOVA's cognitive architecture. It provides a unified, graph-based system for managing insights and assumptions. This allows for a deeper and more interconnected understanding of the user and the world.

*   **Cognitive Graph:** The Cortex manages a "cognitive graph" where insights, assumptions, and memories are all represented as nodes. These nodes are then connected by links that represent the relationships between them (e.g., "elaborates_on", "conflicts_with", "created_from").
*   **Centrality Calculation:** The Cortex calculates a weighted degree centrality for each node in the graph. The weights for different relationship types are configurable in `main_config.yaml`, allowing for a more accurate measure of a node's importance.
*   **Dynamic Relationship Weights:** The relationship weights are not static. The Cortex periodically analyzes the cognitive graph to determine the impact of different relationship types on the generation of high-centrality nodes and meta-insights. It then adjusts the weights accordingly, making the system more adaptive.
*   **Psychological Memory:** The Cortex performs a sophisticated emotion analysis on cognitive nodes, adding a rich psychological dimension to the cognitive graph. This allows the AI to have a more empathetic and personal relationship with the user.
*   **Deep Reflection:** The `/reflect` command triggers a deep reflection process within the Cortex. The Cortex analyzes the entire cognitive graph to:
    *   **Link Orphans:** Identify nodes with few or no connections and use the LLM to find and create links to other relevant nodes.
    *   **Generate Meta-Insights:** Find clusters of highly interconnected nodes using a robust graph traversal algorithm and use the LLM to synthesize them into higher-level "meta-insights".
*   **Graph Pruning:** To prevent cognitive degradation, the Cortex periodically prunes the graph, archiving nodes that are old, have low centrality, and are not well-connected. This process is configurable in `main_config.yaml`.
*   **Insight Development:** The `/develop_insight <node_id>` command allows the user to trigger the development of a specific insight. The Cortex will then use the LLM to generate a more detailed and developed version of the insight.
*   **Proactive Engine:** The Cortex is home to the Proactive Engine, which periodically analyzes the cognitive graph to find interesting, underdeveloped, or highly-connected areas. It considers nodes with low centrality (underdeveloped areas) and high centrality (high-potential areas) to generate more relevant and insightful proactive suggestions for the user.

### 3.4. Document Processing: On-Demand Learning from Documents

JENOVA can learn from documents by using the `/develop_insight` command. When this command is used without a `node_id`, it triggers a robust, on-demand process within the `Cortex` that scans the `src/jenova/docs` folder for documents and integrates them into the AI's knowledge base.

*   **Triggering:** The document processing is triggered exclusively by the user with the `/develop_insight` command. It does not run automatically at startup, giving the user full control.
*   **Knowledge Integration:** The `Cortex` creates a `document` node in the cognitive graph for each processed document. It then chunks the content and performs a comprehensive analysis on each chunk to extract not just a summary, but also key takeaways and a list of questions the text can answer. This creates a rich, multi-layered understanding of the document's content. For each chunk, a main `insight` node is created for the summary, with additional `insight` nodes for each key takeaway and `question` nodes for each generated question, all intricately linked to the summary and the parent document node. This creates a rich, interconnected web of knowledge.
*   **Duplicate Prevention:** The `Cortex` keeps track of processed files and their last modification times in `processed_documents.json` within the user's data directory. This prevents the system from reprocessing files that have not changed, making the process efficient and saving resources.

### 3.5. Reflective Insight Engine

The Insight Engine allows JENOVA to learn continuously. The system is proactive, organized, and reflective, ensuring that knowledge is captured, categorized, and interconnected efficiently.

*   **Concern-Based Organization:** Insights are organized into "concerns" or "topics." When an insight is generated, the system first searches for an existing, relevant concern to group it with. This prevents knowledge fragmentation and creates a more structured understanding of topics. If no relevant concern exists, a new one is created.
*   **Cortex Integration:** When an insight is saved, it is also added as a node to the Cortex. This allows the insight to be linked to other cognitive nodes, such as the memories that spawned it or other related insights.
*   **Generation:** Periodically (by default, every 5 conversational turns), the `CognitiveEngine` prompts the LLM to analyze recent conversation history to extract a significant takeaway. This insight is then passed to the `InsightManager`, which intelligently files it under the most appropriate concern and adds it to the Cortex.
*   **Storage:** Insights are saved in a hierarchical structure within the user-specific data directory: `~/.jenova-ai/users/<username>/insights/<concern_name>/`.
*   **Reflection and Reorganization:** The `/reflect` command triggers a deep reflection process in the Cortex, which reorganizes and interlinks all cognitive nodes, including insights.

### 3.6. Assumption System

JENOVA actively forms assumptions about the user to build a more accurate mental model. This system allows the AI to move beyond explicitly stated facts and begin to infer user preferences, goals, and knowledge levels.

*   **Cortex Integration:** When an assumption is added, it is also added as a node to the Cortex. This allows the assumption to be linked to other cognitive nodes, providing more context for the assumption.
*   **Generation:** Periodically (by default, every 7 conversational turns), the `CognitiveEngine` analyzes the conversation to form an assumption about the user.
*   **Storage:** Assumptions are stored in a dedicated `assumptions.json` file in the user's data directory. Each assumption is categorized by its status: `unverified`, `verified`, `true`, or `false`.
*   **Verification:** The `/verify` command allows the user to help the AI validate its assumptions. The AI will ask a clarifying question to confirm or deny an unverified assumption. Based on the user's response, the assumption will be moved to the `true` or `false` category. The AI also proactively verifies assumptions during the conversation.

### 3.7. Self-Optimizing Context Window

To maximize performance, the `LLMInterface` dynamically configures the context window (`n_ctx`). On startup, it performs a "dry run" to load the model's metadata and read its maximum supported context length. This value is then used to override the default `context_size` set in `main_config.yaml`, ensuring the AI always uses the largest possible context window the model was trained on, without requiring manual configuration.

### 3.8. Multi-Layered Long-Term Memory

JENOVA's memory is not a monolith. It's a sophisticated, multi-layered system managed by `ChromaDB`, a vector database. All memory is stored on a per-user basis.

*   **Episodic Memory (`EpisodicMemory`):** Stores a turn-by-turn history of conversations. Each episode is enriched with extracted entities, emotions, and a timestamp.
*   **Semantic Memory (`SemanticMemory`):** Stores factual knowledge. Each fact is enriched with its source, a confidence level, and its temporal validity.
*   **Procedural Memory (`ProceduralMemory`):** Stores "how-to" information and instructions. Each procedure is enriched with its goal, a list of steps, and its context.
*   **Insight Memory (`InsightManager`):** While not a ChromaDB instance, the collection of saved insight files acts as a fourth, highly dynamic memory layer.

### 3.9. Fine-Tuning Data Generation

JENOVA is designed for continuous improvement. The insights generated during its operation can be used to create a dataset for fine-tuning the base model itself.

*   **Data Preparation (`finetune/train.py`):** This script gathers all the `.json` insight files from `~/.jenova-ai/users/<username>/insights/` and transforms them into a `finetune_train.jsonl` file. The script is configurable and can be used to generate a dataset for fine-tuning a model in a separate program.

## 4. System-Wide Installation

JENOVA is designed to be installed once on a system by an administrator and then be available to all users, while keeping each user's data completely separate and private.

### 4.1. For Administrators

To install JENOVA on the system, run the installation script with root privileges.

1.  **Prerequisites:**
    *   A Linux-based operating system
    *   `git`, `python3`, and `python3-pip` installed
    *   Internet connection for downloading the Gemma 3 4B (NoVision) model

2.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/orpheus497/jenova-ai.git
    cd jenova-ai
    ```

3.  **Run the Installation Script:**
    Execute the script with `sudo`. It handles installation of all dependencies, downloads the Gemma 3 4B (NoVision) model to `/usr/local/share/jenova-ai/models`, and makes the `jenova` command available system-wide.
    ```bash
    sudo ./install.sh
    ```
    
    The installation script automatically downloads gghfez/gemma-3-4b-novision from HuggingFace and installs it to the system-wide model directory.

### 4.2. Uninstallation

To completely remove JENOVA AI from the system, including all user data and downloaded models, an uninstallation script is provided. It must be run with root privileges.

1.  **Navigate to the repository directory:**
    ```bash
    cd jenova-ai
    ```

2.  **Run the Uninstallation Script:**
    Execute the script with `sudo`. It will guide you through the process of removing the application, all user data, and the language model.
    ```bash
    sudo ./uninstall.sh
    ```

### 4.3. For Users

Once an administrator has installed JENOVA, no further setup is required. You can start interacting with the AI immediately.

*   **Running the Application:** Simply open your terminal and type the command:
    ```bash
    jenova
    ```
*   **User-Specific Data:** The first time you run the application, a private directory will be created at `~/.jenova-ai/users/<your_username>/`. All of your conversations, memories, and learned insights will be stored here, inaccessible to other users.

## 5. User Guide

Interaction with JENOVA is primarily through natural language.

-   **User Input:** Simply type your message and press Enter.
-   **Exiting:** To quit the application, type `exit` and press Enter.

### Commands
JENOVA responds to a set of powerful commands that act as direct instructions for its cognitive processes. These commands are treated as system actions, not conversational input, and are therefore **not stored in JENOVA's conversational memory**.

-   `/help`: Displays a comprehensive help message, detailing each command's purpose and impact.
-   `/insight`: Triggers the AI to analyze the current conversation history and generate new, high-quality insights. These insights are stored in JENOVA's long-term memory and contribute to its evolving understanding.
-   `/reflect`: Initiates a deep reflection process within JENOVA's Cortex. This command reorganizes and interlinks all existing cognitive nodes (insights, memories, assumptions), identifies patterns, and generates higher-level meta-insights, significantly enhancing JENOVA's overall intelligence and coherence.
-   `/memory-insight`: Prompts JENOVA to perform a broad search across its multi-layered long-term memory (episodic, semantic, procedural) to develop new insights or assumptions based on its accumulated knowledge.
-   `/meta`: Generates a new, higher-level meta-insight by analyzing clusters of existing insights within the Cortex. This helps JENOVA to form more abstract conclusions and identify overarching themes.
-   `/verify`: Starts the assumption verification process. Jenova will present an unverified assumption it has made about you and ask for clarification, allowing you to confirm or deny it. This refines JENOVA's understanding of your preferences and knowledge.
-   `/train`: Provides instructions on how to create a training file for fine-tuning the model with your own data.
-   `/develop_insight [node_id]`: This command has dual functionality:
    -   If a `node_id` is provided: JENOVA will take an existing insight and generate a more detailed and developed version of it, adding more context or connections.
    -   If no `node_id` is provided: Jenova will scan the `src/jenova/docs` directory for new or updated documents, process their content, and integrate new insights and summaries into its cognitive graph. This is how Jenova learns from external documentation.
-   `/learn_procedure`: Initiates an interactive, guided process to teach Jenova a new procedure. Jenova will prompt you for the procedure's name, individual steps, and expected outcome, ensuring structured and comprehensive intake of procedural knowledge. This information is stored in JENOVA's procedural memory, allowing it to recall and apply the procedure in relevant contexts.
