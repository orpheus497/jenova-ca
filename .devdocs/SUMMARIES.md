## Session 1 Summary

### Metadata
- **Date:** [Current Date]
- **Agent:** Copilot Coding Agent
- **Duration:** Single session
- **Phase:** 1 - Initialization

### Objectives
1. ✅ Analyze repository structure
2. ✅ Create .devdocs/ documentation structure
3. ✅ Create multi-session code review plan
4. ✅ Document commenting standards
5. ⏳ Await permission for Phase 2

### Accomplishments

#### Repository Analysis
- Identified 57 Python files
- Identified 1 Go file (tui/main.go)
- Identified 7 existing Markdown files
- Counted ~6,117 lines of Python code
- Mapped component structure

#### Documentation Created
1. **BRIEFING.md** - Current project status and overview
2. **PROGRESS.md** - Progress tracking with file review matrix
3. **SESSION_HANDOFF.md** - Session continuity document
4. **DECISIONS_LOG.md** - Architectural decisions with rationale
5. **TODOS.md** - Task lists organized by session
6. **PLANS.md** - Comprehensive multi-session review plan
7. **TESTS.md** - Test documentation and procedures
8. **SUMMARIES.md** - This file

#### Key Decisions Made
- DEC-001: Documentation folder structure adopted
- DEC-002: Code commenting format standardized
- DEC-003: Multi-session review approach defined
- DEC-004: Existing comments preservation policy

### Files Modified
- Created: 8 files in .devdocs/

### Blockers Encountered
- None

### Lessons Learned
1. Repository already has partial commenting in some files
2. Consistent format exists and should be followed
3. Multi-session approach is necessary for thorough review

### Metrics
- Files created: 8
- Files reviewed: 0 (documentation session)
- Comments added: N/A
- Progress: 5% of overall plan

### Next Session Recommendations
1. Begin Phase 2 with Core Engine files
2. Start with main.py, main_bubbletea.py, llm_interface.py
3. Update all .devdocs/ files after changes
4. Request explicit permission before proceeding
